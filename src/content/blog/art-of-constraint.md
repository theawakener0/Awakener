This website is black and white. No colors. No gradients. No grain textures. Just black, white, and one shade of gray.

## Intentional Limitation

Constraints aren't restrictions—they're creative fuel. When you limit your palette, every choice matters more.

The constraints for this site were strict:

- **Colors**: #000000, #FFFFFF, #A1A1AA only
- **Typography**: Two fonts maximum (Playfair Display + JetBrains Mono)
- **No grain**: Clean, sharp edges only
- **No shadows**: Depth through hierarchy, not blur
- **No gradients**: Contrast or nothing

## What Emerges

With color removed, you're forced to find other ways to create hierarchy:

- **Scale**: Massive serif headers against monospace body
- **Space**: Generous whitespace becomes a design element
- **Interaction**: Hover states use hard borders, not shadows
- **Motion**: Subtle transforms replace visual noise

## The Monochrome Advantage

Black and white isn't boring—it's timeless. It removes distraction. The content becomes the color.

In a world of bloated, over-designed websites, brutalist minimalism stands out by *not* trying to stand out.

## Engineering Identity

This isn't decoration. It's expression.

Every decision reinforces the core message: engineering intelligence at bare-metal speed. No bloat. No waste. Just precision.

The constraint becomes the brand.
